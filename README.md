# Tree-D-Visualizer

# Are you a 3D artist who wants to promote his art in front of potential clients? 

Then, we have the right solution! Introducing Tree D Visualizer, the model visualizer of the FUTURE! 
* Upload models
* Have models organized on your wall page
* Look for inspiration from other artists.

# Wait, wait, wait, how is this different from other platforms? It seems to be the same thing...

Have you ever visited a website for 3D Models? They are all the same, pages full of nonesense that distract you from the real deal, THE MODELS. We're in 2021, people, everything is minimalistic, and people don't care about your useless ads.

So what did we do?
 
Got rid of all the nonsense! Now there is only quality content that people want to see.

# Cool, so how do I use your platform?

Easy, just browse the main page to see what other made if you're just regular user. 

If you are an artist, go ahead and make an account, then upload your models. It's as simple as that!
